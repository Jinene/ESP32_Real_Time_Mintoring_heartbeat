ESP32_Real_Time_Monitoring_Heartbeat

ESP32 Real-Time Heartbeat Monitoring System is an IoT project that reads heartbeat data from a sensor (like MAX30102 or Pulse Sensor), displays it on an LCD/OLED screen, and publishes it via MQTT for real-time visualization on a Node-RED dashboard.

Features:

Real-time heartbeat monitoring

Display on OLED or LCD

MQTT-based data transmission

Visualization on Node-RED dashboard

Optional alerts for abnormal heart rate

Hardware Required:

ESP32 development board

Heartbeat/Pulse sensor

OLED or LCD display

Wi-Fi network

Software Required:

Arduino IDE

Node-RED

MQTT broker (local or cloud)

Use Cases:

Personal health monitoring

IoT-based real-time health dashboards

Educational projects on ESP32, sensors, and MQTT
